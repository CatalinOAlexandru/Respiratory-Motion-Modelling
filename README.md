# Respiratory Motion Modelling

Part of a group project of a master module. We worked with MR images to building and evaluating respiratory motions. This is important due to the internal motion of the lungs caused by breathing which adds a new challenge when trying to take multiple images. Motion could cause different artefacts as well such as ghosting and therefore it is important to figure out how to solve the motion problems in order to improve the future medical procedures.
